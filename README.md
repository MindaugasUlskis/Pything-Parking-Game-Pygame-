# Car Parking Game

## Description
This is a 2D car parking game created using Python and the Pygame library. The game was developed as part of a college task, where the objective was to create a game of our choosing. In this game, players are challenged to park a car in designated parking spots within multiple levels.

## Features
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
- Realistic car physics and controls.
- Different parking scenarios and challenges.
- Visual indicators for successful parking and collisions.
- AI passerby
